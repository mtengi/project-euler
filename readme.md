Project Euler Solutions
==

Solutions to some Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
Most are full solutions, while a few are works in progress.
Most are also in the decently to very efficient range -- I tried to avoid
brute force solutions wherever possible. I also tried to go for short and
elegant solutions beucase why write more when you could write less?
